# Project Description

Our game is a recreation of Candy Crush, but instead of candy, it's fruit. There is a 10x10 board full of randomized fruit, in which your goal is to match multiple fruits together in a row (horizontally or vertically) to clear and gain points. Then, the board will refill with new fruits, dropping from the top to bottom. Every time a fruit is cleared in a match of 3 fruits, 100 points are rewarded per fruit. For special (rarer) combinations, such as matching 4 or 5 fruits in a row, there were be special fruits that can clear its entire row/column or clear the entire board. More points will be rewarded for those special combinations. As you continue to gain points, you will level up; for every 5 levels, a new fruit will be added to your board for up to 3 new fruits. This increases the difficulty of the game as less matches will occur.

# Intended usage:

Click anywhere on the Home screen to start the game.

To swap two fruits in order to create a valid swap, click on one fruit first and then click on the fruit you want to swap it with. Their grid background will turn green, and if it's a valid move (creates a match consisting of 3 or more fruits), the swap will occur. If not, nothing will happen.

To regenerate the board if there are no more matches or you don't like your current board, click on the Regenerate button and wait for it to finish regenerating. 

To try the special for 4 matching fruits, click on the Special-4 button. A valid match of blueberries will spawn on the board, and you can complete the swap to demo the special move.

To try the special for 5 matching fruits, click on the Special-5 button. A valid match of blueberries will spawn on the board, and you can complete the swap to demo the special move.

To go back to the home screen and stop playing, click on the Home button. Your progress will be saved and you may resume.

To view your current progress, there is a scoreboard below the grid that displays your total points, your current level, and your progress towards the next level.
