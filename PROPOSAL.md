# IDEAS:

1 Candy Crush
We will make a 10x10 grid with different images (symbols) that represent the fruit. We will have a scoreboard at the top that continuously updates. If you link 4, you can clear out the entire row or column. If you link 5, the special in the middle will clear the entire board and then regenerate. Each item you clear out will give you 100 points. If you get a piece that simultaneously clears out a row and a column, you get 2x the points per piece cleared.

2 Block Blast
We will make an 8x8 grid. It will start off clear, and then we will generate three shaped
(from a bank of possible shapes) blocks. The blocks will be randomized. However, if there is only a certain amount of clear spaces left in the board, then the probability of a larger randomized block (ex. 3x3 block) will be significantly lower. You cannot be given 3 of the same blocks at a time, only 2 of the same maximum. If you clear the entire board, all the next blocks will be the same randomized color. For each block that you add, you will get 50 points multiplied by the number of squares in the block. Every row/column cleared will give you 100 points. If you simultaneously clear out multiple rows or multiple columns, you get 1.5x the points per row/column. If you simultaneously clear out a row and a column, you get 2x the points per row/column.

3 QSWatermelon
There will be a big, clear board (not a grid). We will have different images (symbols) that represent the different fruits, which drop down one at a time. You are able to drag the fruits to drop down at any point on the x-axis (all drop from the same height). If a fruit touches another fruit that’s the same, it will combine with that fruit to form the next “level” of a fruit, which will be larger/take up more space in the board. The final goal is to combine enough fruits together to build up to a watermelon. If you can get two watermelons to connect, you will clear the entire board. Once you run out of space on the board, the game ends. A fruit touching another fruit will apply force to it, making them roll/tumble. Each fruit added gives you 50 points. Each combination gives you 100 points, increasing by 25 points for each greater combination. The clearing of the board gives you 1000 points.
